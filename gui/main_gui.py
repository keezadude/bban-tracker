BBAN-Tracker GUI - Modular Architecture Entry Point

This file provides backward compatibility by importing all the modular
GUI components that have been extracted for the Event-Driven Architecture.

For new development, import the specific components you need directly:
- gui.main_window.MainWindow
- gui.tracking_panel.TrackerSetupPage 
- gui.projection_panel.ProjectionSetupPage
- gui.system_hub_panel.SystemHubPage
- gui.calibration_wizard.CalibrationWizard
